Introduction
This document describes the Hospital Management System (HMS) and its Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) / UML Class Diagram.
The system is designed to manage:
- Patients
- Doctors
- Departments
- Appointments
- Treatments
- Prescriptions
- Lab Tests
- Rooms
- Billing
- Insurance

The diagram models real-world hospital workflows and the relationships between entities, making it easier to implement in a database or software system.
